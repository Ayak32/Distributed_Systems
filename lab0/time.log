I discussed my solution with: Chatgpt.

discussion:  
Most of the time I spent on this pset was dedicated to learning Go and setting up (and debugging) the environment. 
The coding was not too difficult, especially with the hints the given in the comments above each function. I used Chatgpt to help me 
fix syntax errors (and improve Golang style), find bugs, and explain the functionality of certian tests. It was a great learning tool and 
now I feel a bit more comfortable with Golang and Docker. I believe if I had more consistent availability (several consequentive hours) to Work
on this pset, I would have finished it sooner. Especially early on, working on it for an hour and having to come back later slowed my progress
